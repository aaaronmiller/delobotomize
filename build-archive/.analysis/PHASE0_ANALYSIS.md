## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0
Dependencies: Phase 0 extraction complete

- Set up prompt externalization infrastructure
- Implement prompt loader with versioning
- Create optimization metadata schema
- Build initial knowledge graph

### Phase 1
Dependencies: Phase 0 tasks complete

- Implement core scanner/parser from Artifact #3
- Build classifier from categorized insights
- Create context preservation system
- Set up iterative testing framework

### Phase 2
Dependencies: Phase 1 tasks complete

- Build analysis dashboard
- Implement auto-optimization for prompts
- Create meta-learning system
- Develop context health metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Set up prompt externalization infrastructure**
   - Create `prompts/` directory structure
   - Implement `src/core/prompt-loader.ts`
   - Add versioning and metadata schemas

2. **Begin Phase 1 implementation**
   - Core scanner from Artifact #3
   - Classifier from insights
   - Context preservation system

3. **Establish optimization loop**
   - Run Phase 0 extraction regularly
   - Track prompt performance
   - Iteratively improve based on metrics

This analysis provides the foundation for implementing the Prompt-Layered Architecture discovered during the extraction process.
