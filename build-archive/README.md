- **.analysis/** - Internal analysis artifacts

## Why Archived?

These materials were valuable during development but are not needed by end users:

1. **Build artifacts** - Tracked progress but now complete
2. **Research materials** - Background research, not user-facing
3. **Design documents** - Internal architecture details
4. **Source materials** - Inspiration/extraction sources

## For Developers
