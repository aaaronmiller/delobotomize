# Iterative Design Specification
## Strategic ROI-Based Component Optimization

> **"Focus iteration budget on components with the highest post-MVP improvement ROI"**

## Philosophy

The iterative design framework evaluates each component for its post-MVP optimization potential, allocating development effort to maximize impact per investment.

### Scoring Criteria (30 points max)

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Modification Cost | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Lower cost = higher iteration ROI |
| Impact on UX | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Higher impact = more value per improvement |
| Feedback Signal Quality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Better data = faster convergence |
| Failure Cost | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Higher consequences = more value getting right |
| Usage Frequency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | More frequent = more opportunities to learn |
| Complexity/Uncertainty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Higher complexity = less likely right first try |

### Priority Tiers

- **TIER 1: CRITICAL** (≥25 points) - 60% iteration budget
- **TIER 2: HIGH** (20-24 points) - 30% iteration budget
- **TIER 3: MEDIUM** (15-19 points) - 10% iteration budget
- **TIER 4: LOW** (<15 points) - 0% iteration budget
- **TIER 5: CORE** - Optimize during build, stabilize post-MVP
